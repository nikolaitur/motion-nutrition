            "text_1": "<p>We recommend Unplug Kids Bedtime to children 4 and over. Above the age of 7, you may wish to increase the dose to 1.5 teaspoons (about 4g). From teenage years onwards, we recommend our Unplug capsule supplement.<\/p>",
            "title_2": "When and how should I give Kids Bedtime?",
            "text_2": "<p>This is a super easy-to-use powder. For fussy eaters, we recommend mixing a teaspoon at dinner time - in mashed potato or mashed banana for example. Alternatively, mix into warm milk before bed.<\/p>",
            "title_3": "Is it safe?",
            "text_3": "<p>Yes, absolutely. We've taken great care to formulate a product which is not only safe, but truly beneficial for children's development. <\/p><p>In addition to the nutritional goodness in Kids Bedtime, you won't find any sugar, sweeteners or flavourings which are so common in children's products.<\/p><p>As with all our products at Motion Nutrition, benefits will build up with regular use and there are no side effects so you can use Kids Bedtime ongoing.<\/p>",
            "title_4": "Why are there carriers?",
            "text_4": "<p>The stability, safety and efficacy of our ingredients are our number top priority. In order to ensure this consistency, we need to use microscopic amounts of carrier ingredients like vegetable cellulose and maltodextrin. Rest assured these are in such tiny quantities that they do not even carry any calorific values, unlike sugar-based kids products.<\/p>",

            "title_2": "How quickly will I feel a difference with Unplug?",
            "text_2": "<p>With Unplug, benefits build up over time. Most people will feel some initial sleep improvements from the very first night, and this will gradually improve over weeks and months.<br\/><br\/>During the first month, make a note of how quickly you fall asleep on average. You may notice this changing after the first 4 weeks.<br\/><br\/>After 3-6 months your “new normal” settles in and you’ll look forward to a great sleep, night after night.<\/p>",
            "title_3": "Is Unplug a sleeping pill?",
            "text_3": "<p>Not in the medicinal sense. Unplug helps induce feelings of cosiness and promotes deep sleep, but it is not a medication. It is a food-state supplement and a natural sleep supporter. It works by providing the nutritional building blocks your brain needs to produce sleep and relaxation hormones.<\/p>",
            "title_4": "Are there any side effects?",
            "text_4": "<p>You may experience some wild, vivid dreams over the first few nights as your brain catches up on sleep debt. Don’t worry! This is a sign that you are getting deep sleep, which is great. Typically, these intense dreams will go away after a week or so once you’ve caught up on sleep debt.<\/p>",
